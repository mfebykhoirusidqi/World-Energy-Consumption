# OUR WORLD ENERGY DATA COMSUMPTION
# Global Energy Transition Analysis & Forecast (2000-2030)


📊 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of global energy consumption patterns, focusing on the comparative trajectory of Fossil Fuel Share between major economic blocks: the G7 (developed economies) and BRICS (fast-developing economies), along with a specific focus on Indonesia.

The primary objective is to quantify the pace of global decarbonization and project the World's Fossil Energy Share up to 2030, offering strategic insights for policy-makers and energy stakeholders.


📈 Key Findings & Insights

1. Decarbonization Divide: The G7 group exhibits a clear, accelerated decline in fossil energy dependence, demonstrating a successful transition trajectory.

2. Slower Transition: The BRICS nations show significantly higher (and more varied) consumption of fossil energy per capita, acting as the primary constraint on achieving aggressive global decarbonization targets.

3. 2030 Global Projection: The XGBoost Regressor model forecasts that the global fossil energy share will continue to decline, but the world is projected to remain above the 80% fossil share mark by 2030, underscoring the need for stronger policy intervention, especially in emerging markets.
